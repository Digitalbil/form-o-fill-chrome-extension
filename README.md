# Form-O-Fill Chrome Extension

### The programmable form filler for developers.

This is a chrome extension for filling out forms in webpages.
This extension is targeted at web developers who frequently must fill out long \<form>s while working on a website.
The configuration is done via a rule definition file written in javascript.

# TODOS (in that order)

- Document that libs can only be loaded from https:// URLS (CSP limitation) (see testcases/rule-add-library.js)
  Move libs.js to global and make it available inside the promise wrapped before function (form_utils.js)
- Options -> Libs add url (https) with reload button and name -> add via Libs.add for all rules
- write help for adding libraries dynamically via before function
- allow #help-basic to jump to #help and then #help-basic
- make context click extract that form instead of showing the overlay.
- syntax check for "before: function(resolve)". Must include "resolve"
- describe permissions requirements in "about"
- limit the number of tabs, add dropdown if too many.
- Allow local file loading of JSON files and merge them last into rules. Use File API.
- Import Rule Definitions from other URLs via XHR (But how to validate them?)
- changelog menu entry in options
- Extract ALL strings/texts to messages
- add "de" locale at least
- autocomplete for moment.js and chance.js in ACE (see http://plnkr.co/edit/6MVntVmXYUbjR0DI82Cr?p=preview)
- show annotations in editor for all errors

# HOW TO REPORT ERRORS
Got an error you want to report? Perfect!  
Here are a few steps to make the error debugging easier on our side:

- Notice which version of Form-O-Fill you are using (Tools -> Extensions)
- Checkout (clone) this repository
- Checkout the version tag you noted earlier (eg. git checkout v1.0.0)
- If a rule does strange things, copy that rule from the rule editor and save it somewhere (eg. form-o-fill-v1.0.0-error-rules.txt)
- Deactivate the version of Form-O-Fill you got from the chrome web store.
- In Tools -> Extensions click on "Developer Mode" (top right) then click on "Load unpacked extension ..." and choose the "src" path of the git clone.
  See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked for details.
- Paste your saved rule in the rule editor.
- Bug still reproducable? Very good.
- File an issue (https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/issues)
- Attach the errornous rule, a test HTML file activating that rule.
- If possible also export the logs you get with the cloned Form-O-Fill: Form-O-Fill Options -> Logs -> Download Logs
  Check that file for private / sensitive imformation and attach a gist to the issue you filed.
- The Form-O-Fill Team thanks you for taking the time.
- Perhaps ... a pull request to fix that bug :)
