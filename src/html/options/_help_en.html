    <h3>Capturing forms</h3>
    <p>
      To capture the state of a form you are currently seeing follow these simple steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fill the form with all info you want to save. Don't submit that form!
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the Form-O-Fill button (<img src="../../images/help/button-no-match.png" />) to the right of the location bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        The extensions popup window will appear. Click the "Create one?" Link.<br />
        <img src="../../images/help/form-extract-notification.png" class="li-block" />
      </li>
      <li>
        Form-O-Fill will find all <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags in the page and highlight them with an overlay
        <img src="../../images/help/form-extract-overlay.png" class="li-block" />
        Click the overlay of the form you want to extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        A notification will appear telling you that the form extraction was successful.<br />
        You can click that notification and it will take you to the options panel.
        <img src="../../images/help/form-extract-finished-notification.png" class="li-block" />
      </li>
      <li>
        A message (<span class="warning"></span>) on top of the rule editor allows you to append the extracted rule to the current tab's rule definitions.<br />
        Click "Append extracted rule" and then save the rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Done.
      </li>
    </ul>
