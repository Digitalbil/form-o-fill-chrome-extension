  </li>
  <li>
    Form-O-Fill will find all <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags in the page and highlight them with an overlay

    Click the overlay of the form you want to extract.
  </li>
  <li>
    A notification will appear telling you that the form extraction was successful.<br />

    A message (<span class="warning"></span>) on top of the rule editor allows you to append the extracted rule to the current tab's rule definitions.<br />
    Click "Append extracted rule" and then save the rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Done.
  </li>
</ul>
