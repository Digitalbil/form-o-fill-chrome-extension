<h3>The rule editor</h3>
<p>
  The rule editor is where you create the rule definitions for all you forms.

  You can organize your rules into up to 6 tabs. <br/>
  Clicking on a tab activates that tab and clicking again allows you to rename that tab.<br/>
  Press the green floppy disc symbol to save your tab settings.

<p>
  Remove a tab (and its rules!) by clicking on the minus icon on the right of the tab.<br />
  Add a new tab by clicking on the plus symbol on the last tab.
