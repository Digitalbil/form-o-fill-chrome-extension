<h3>Filling forms</h3>
<p>
  Filling forms is easy. When Form-O-Fill finds a matching rule for the site you are currently on, it will display the number of matching rules in it's button.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the number of matching rules is zero, the extension will display "n/a" (<img src="../../images/help/button-no-match.png" />).
  </li>
  <li>
    If the number of matching rules is one, the extension will display "1" (<img src="../../images/help/form-filling-one-match.png" />).
    Clicking on the button will then fill the matching form with the rule's data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are multiple matches and you click on the Form-O-Fill button you will be presented with a popup where you can select (by clicking) the appropriate rule.

  </li>
</ul>
<h3>In case of an error</h3>
<p>
  Since you can use functions as values there may be errors executing those when filling the form. <br />
  Those errors will reported as an notification.<br />

  Clicking on the notification will bring you back to the rules editor and display the error to you.<br />
