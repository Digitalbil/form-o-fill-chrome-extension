<h3>Automatic rematch of rules</h3>
<p>
  Form-O-Fill searches for matching rules whenever you visit a webpage or the URL changes.<br />
  This is usually enough but for those cases where you need a re-matching of the rules without<br />
  one of those two events mentioned above you can use a feature called "<em>Automatic rematch</em>". 
</p>
<p>
  If enabled Form-O-Fill will search for matching rules every two seconds.
</p>
<p>
  This is very useful for apps that change the DOM on the fly.<br />
  Those changes will not be detected if <em>automatic rematch</em> is turned off.
</p>
<p>
  There are two ways to toggle <em>automatic rematch</em> on or off.<br />
  You can use the option in the settings panel or click "Automatic rematch" in the extension popup:<br />
  <img src="../../images/help/popup-rematch.png" /><br />
  The popup text will <span style="color: Red">turn red</span> if not active and <span style="color: green">turn green</span> if the automatic rematch is active.
</p>
<p>
  Once active the extension icon text background will also <span style="color: green">turn green</span>:<br />
