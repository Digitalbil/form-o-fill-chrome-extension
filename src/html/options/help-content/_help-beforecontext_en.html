<h3>The context object in before/after functions</h3>
<p>
  The context object passed as the before/after functions second parameter has a certain structure.<br />
  It contains a method that describes the URL form-o-fill is working in (<code>.url</code>), a method to find HTML in the webpage (<code>.findHtml()</code>) and a method to store and retrieve data between rule executions (<code>.storage</code>).
</p>

<h3>The .url part of the context</h3>
  Assuming the tab to be filled has an url like
<p>
  <code>https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/search?q=context#somehash</code>
</p>
<p>
  the <code>url</code> part in the context object will look like:
</p>
<a name="help-beforecontext-findhtml" class="anchor" />
<pre>
  url: {
    url: "https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/search?q=context#somehash",
    protocol: "https:",
    host: "github.com",
    port: "",
    path: "/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/search",
    query: "?q=context",
    hash: "#somehash"
  }
</pre>

<h3>Using the HTML finder in a before/after function</h3>
<p>
  The context object also includes a function that allows you to modify your rules based on the HTML of the page the rule is executed in.
</p>
<p>
  You pass a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/" target="_blank">jQuery compatible selector</a> to the finder (<code>.findHtml()</code>). It will return a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise">Promise</a> on which you can call <code>.then(function(html) {});</code> on.<br />
  The first and only parameter to that function will be the found HTML of the tag (aka. outerHTML) or <code>null</code> if the selector was not found.
</p>
<p>
  Use it in a before function to construct your data return value like so:
</p>
<pre>
  before: function (resolve, context) {
    var data = {
      someThing: "Some Text",
    };
    context.findHtml("a.a-link").then(function(html) {
      data.linkHtml = html;
      resolve(data);
    });
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Please notice that the call to <code>findHtml</code> is asynchronous so you should call the before function's <code>resolve</code> inside the findHtml <code>then</code> function.
</p>

<h3>Saving and loading values in before/after functions with .storage</h3>
<p>
  Before functions are usually used to prepare data to be filled into form fields.<br />
  Using the <code>context.storage</code> functions you can store arbitrary data and restore it on demand.<br />
  This is very useful for storing data between workflow steps.<br />
  This is also available in after functions.
</p>
<p>
  To save data use <code>context.storage.set("key", {some: "data"});</code>.<br />
  To load data use <code>context.storage.get("key")</code>, which will - in this example - return <code>{some: "data"}</code>.<br />
  Delete all stored data with <code>context.storage.delete()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Values stored in this way can be used in other before functions (eg. in another workflow step) or <a href="#help-functions-context">by value functions</a>.
</p>
