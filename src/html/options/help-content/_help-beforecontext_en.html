<h3>The context object in before functions</h3>
<p>
  The context object passed as the before functions second parameter has a certain structure.
  Assuming the tab to be filled has an url like
</p>
<p>
  <code>https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/search?q=context#somehash</code>
</p>
<p>
  the <code>url</code> part in the context object will look like
</p>
<a name="help-beforecontext-findhtml" />
<pre>
  url: {
    url: "https://github.com/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/search?q=context#somehash",
    protocol: "https:",
    host: "github.com",
    port: "",
    path: "/form-o-fill/form-o-fill-chrome-extension/search",
    query: "?q=context",
    hash: "#somehash"
  }
</pre>

<h3>Using the HTML finder in a before function</h3>
<p>
  The context object also includes a function that allows you to modify your rules based on the HTML of the page the rule is executed in.
</p>
<p>
  You pass a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/" target="_blank">jQuery compatible selector</a> and a callback function to the finder. The callback is then called with the found HTML.
</p>
<p>
  Use it in a before function to construct your data return value like so:
</p>
<pre>
  before: function (resolve, context) {
    var data = {
      someThing: "Some Text",
    };
    context.findHtml("a.a-link", function(outerHtml) {
      data.linkHtml = outerHtml;
      resolve(data);
    });
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Please notice that the call to <code>linkHtml</code> is asynchronous so you should call the before function <code>resolve</code> inside the findHtml callback.
</p>
