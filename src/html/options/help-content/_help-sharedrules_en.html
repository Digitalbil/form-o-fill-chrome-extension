<h3>Sharing field definitions</h3>
<p>
  It is possible to share field definitions between rules.<br />
  This enables you to write a set of field definitions once and insert those somewhere in another rule's workflow.
</p>
<p>
  Imaging a rule that fills a long registration form with data.<br />
  Also imaging that you need to test that form three times with the only difference being a single <code>input</code> field. 
</p>
<p>
  You could create a single rule <em>without</em> that <code>input</code> field and three rules each importing the shared field definitions and the <code>input</code> field with the unique value.
