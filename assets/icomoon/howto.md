# How to create / use icons in this extension

All icons in this extension were created using the fabulous app at http://icomoon.io/app/

Open that page and drag-drop the selection.json file in there.

Please only use icons from the "Entypo" set.

Download the file (press "Font >" at the bottom and extract it).

Place the icomoon.woff file into src/fonts/ and the selection.json here.
