FORM-O-FILL is an advanced highly programmable form-filler.

It provides form content extraction, one-click form filling, advanced multi-page workflows and more.

Features:
✓ Extract already entered forms to auto-create the rule definition with the click of a button (or two).
✓ Use Javascript to program the rules.
✓ Use static values or dynamically generated values for every field (value functions are just javascript).
✓ Automatically take screenshots
✓ Get nice error reporting when applying the rule to the form doesn't work.
✓ Use before functions to fetch, generate and store data that can then be used in value functions.
✓ Organize your work into tabs. All tabs are searched for matching rules.
✓ Use workflows to create multi page rules.
✓ One click apply of a matching rule or even auto apply the rule.
✓ Two click apply when there are multiple matching rules or workflows.
✓ "Automatic execution" configurable for every rule.
✓ Reuse rules inside other rules (shared rules).
✓ Share rules via the remote URL import feature.
✓ Browser notifications to show you what happened.
