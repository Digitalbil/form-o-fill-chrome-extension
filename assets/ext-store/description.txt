Developers like working on cool apps but every once in a while THE FORM™ comes along to suck all fun out of the developers life.

Working on such form entry processes is in itself usually not fun but filling out a form for test purposes again and again is even worse.

FORM-O-FILL is there to ease that pain.

Features:
✓ Use javascript to program the rules.
✓ Extract already entered forms to auto-create the rule definition with the click of a button (or two).
✓ Use static values or dynamically generated values for every field (value functions are just javascript).
✓ Get nice error reporting when applying the rule to the form doesn't work.
✓ Use before functions to fetch or generate data that can then be used in value functions.
✓ Organize your work into tabs. All tabs are searched for matching rules.
✓ One click apply of a matching rule.
✓ Two click apply when there are multiple matching rules.
✓ Auto apply configurable for each rule
✓ Reuse rules inside other rules
✓ Browser notifications to show you what happened.

Requires:
Chrome 33+

Permissions requested:
- Read all open tabs (Used for finding the tab to fill a form in)
- Read all http/https URLs (Well its a form filler and it should be able to fill data everywhere) 
- Notifications (Show problems and extract notification)
